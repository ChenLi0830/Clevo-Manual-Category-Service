教育咨询销售中，60%顾客互动是从电话完成的。然而电话销售却没有如微信平台和邮件营销一样的优化软件来提升效果。Clevo通过分析销售代表与客户的互动，提供具体详实的话术建议，改善销售策略。它可以分辨出销售代表仅仅在描述产品的特性，还是在强调能为顾客带来的切身利益；是说完销售对话后直接推动用户购买，还是引导客户并提出针对性问题并完成购买。通过Clevo可以帮助销售主管监控电话销售人员表现，提高销售人员业绩，尤其是对新员工及业绩待提高的销售人员，快速提升销售表现，实现业绩增长；北美同类产品VoiceOps称，某上市公司企业的销售部门在使用其服务后，获得近300%的销售业绩提升。



Seventy percent of customer interactions happen over phone calls, yet they don’t have the same optimization technologies as email, which accounts for just 10 percent. Clover analyzes voice interactions to provide recommendations on sales strategy. It can recognize if sales people are only talking about product features instead of benefits, or if they’re pushing to close the sale at the wrong time. The software saves time for managers, which typically spend half their weeks listening in on calls, filling out score cards and making recommendations without data. Clover says one publicly traded client saw a 300 percent increase in its sales call conversion rates. It charges $150 per seat per month, and next Clover wants to move into customer service, success and compliance as it tries to own the enterprise voice space.
